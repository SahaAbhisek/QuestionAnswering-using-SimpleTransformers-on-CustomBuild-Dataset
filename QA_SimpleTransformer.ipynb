Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a highly penetrant, autosomal dominant, human familial cancer predisposition. Although a key role for the tumor suppressor p53 has been implicated in LFS, the genetic and cellular mechanisms underpinning this disease remain unknown. Therefore, modeling LFS in a vertebrate system that is accessible to both large-scale genetic screens and in vivo cell biological studies will facilitate the in vivo dissection of disease mechanisms, help identify candidate genes, and spur the discovery of therapeutic compounds. Here, we describe a forward genetic screen in zebrafish embryos that was used to identify LFS candidate genes, which yielded a p53 mutant (p53(I166T)) that as an adult develops tumors, predominantly sarcomas, with 100% penetrance. As in humans with LFS, tumors arise in heterozygotes and display loss of heterozygosity (LOH). This report of LOH indicates that Knudson's two-hit hypothesis, a hallmark of human autosomal dominant cancer syndromes, can be modeled in zebrafish. Furthermore, as with some LFS mutations, the zebrafish p53(I166T) allele is a loss-of-function allele with dominant-negative activity in vivo. Additionally, we demonstrate that the p53 regulatory pathway, including Mdm2 regulation, is evolutionarily conserved in zebrafish, providing a bona fide biological context in which to systematically uncover novel modifier genes and therapeutic agents for human LFS.\"},\n"," {'qas': [{'id': '530cf4fe960c95ad0c00000b_001',\n","    'question': 'Which type of lung cancer is afatinib used for?',\n","    'answers': [{'text': 'EGFR-mutant NSCLC', 'answer_start': 1203}]}],\n","  'context': 'Clinical perspective of afatinib in non-small cell lung cancer. Reversible ATP-competitive inhibitors targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been established as the most effective treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring \"activating\" mutations in exons 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene. However, clinical activity is limited by acquired resistance which on average develops within 10 months of continued treatment. The mechanisms for acquired resistance include selection of the EGFR T790M mutation in approximately 50% of cases, and MET gene amplification, PIK3CA gene mutation, transdifferentiation into small-cell lung cancer and additional rare or unkown mechanisms. Afatinib is a small molecule covalently binding and inhibiting the EGFR, HER2 and HER4 receptor tyrosine kinases. In preclinical studies, afatinib not only inhibited the growth of models with common activating EGFR mutations, but was also active in lung cancer models harboring wild-type EGFR or the EGFR L858R/T790M double mutant. Clinical efficacy of afatinib has been extensively studied in the LUX-Lung study program. These trials showed promising efficacy in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC or enriched for clinical benefit from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib or erlotinib. Here we review the current status of clinical application of afatinib in NSCLC. We also discuss clinical aspects of resistance to afatinib and strategies for its circumvention.'}]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data[0]['paragraphs'][0]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"qk6rBtqMKM0I","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1642449017282,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Abhisek Saha","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgsbRHkd4Ug7pkvp0UqxcssHlG-AkBHnKY1GNCo=s64","userId":"06504023352493631962"}},"outputId":"62702172-e378-4ca1-ff17-54bd1933751a"},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'qas': [{'id': '52bf208003868f1b06000019_002',\n","   'question': 'What is the inheritance pattern of Li–Fraumeni syndrome?',\n","   'answers': [{'text': 'autosomal dominant', 'answer_start': 213}]}],\n"," 'context': 'Balanced t(11;15)(q23;q15) in a TP53+/+ breast cancer patient from a Li-Fraumeni syndrome family.

Approximately 70% of LFS cases are due to germline mutations in the TP53 gene on chromosome 17p13.1. Mutations have also been found in the CHEK2 gene on chromosome 22q11, and others have been mapped to chromosome 11q23. While characterizing an LFS family with a documented defect in TP53, we found one family member who developed bilateral breast cancer at age 37 yet was homozygous for wild-type TP53. Her mother also developed early-onset primary bilateral breast cancer, and a sister had unilateral breast cancer and a soft tissue sarcoma. Cytogenetic analysis using fluorescence in situ hybridization of a primary skin fibroblast cell line revealed that the patient had a novel balanced reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 11 and 15: t(11;15)(q23;q15). This translocation was not present in a primary skin fibroblast cell line from a brother with neuroblastoma, who was heterozygous for the TP53 mutation. There was no evidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in either the patient or her mother, although a nephew did develop leukemia and died in childhood.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a highly penetrant, autosomal dominant, human familial cancer predisposition. Although a key role for the tumor suppressor p53 has been implicated in LFS, the genetic and cellular mechanisms underpinning this disease remain unknown. Therefore, modeling LFS in a vertebrate system that is accessible to both large-scale genetic screens and in vivo cell biological studies will facilitate the in vivo dissection of disease mechanisms, help identify candidate genes, and spur the discovery of therapeutic compounds. Here, we describe a forward genetic screen in zebrafish embryos that was used to identify LFS candidate genes, which yielded a p53 mutant (p53(I166T)) that as an adult develops tumors, predominantly sarcomas, with 100% penetrance. As in humans with LFS, tumors arise in heterozygotes and display loss of heterozygosity (LOH). This report of LOH indicates that Knudson's two-hit hypothesis, a hallmark of human autosomal dominant cancer syndromes, can be modeled in zebrafish. Furthermore, as with some LFS mutations, the zebrafish p53(I166T) allele is a loss-of-function allele with dominant-negative activity in vivo. Additionally, we demonstrate that the p53 regulatory pathway, including Mdm2 regulation, is evolutionarily conserved in zebrafish, providing a bona fide biological context in which to systematically uncover novel modifier genes and therapeutic agents for human LFS.\",\n","  'qas': [{'id': '52bf208003868f1b06000019_003',\n","    'is_impossible': False,\n","    'question': 'What is the inheritance pattern of Li–Fraumeni syndrome?',\n","    'answers': [{'text': 'autosomal dominant', 'answer_start': 105}]}]},\n"," {'context': 'Clinical perspective of afatinib in non-small cell lung cancer. Reversible ATP-competitive inhibitors targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been established as the most effective treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring \"activating\" mutations in exons 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene. However, clinical activity is limited by acquired resistance which on average develops within 10 months of continued treatment. The mechanisms for acquired resistance include selection of the EGFR T790M mutation in approximately 50% of cases, and MET gene amplification, PIK3CA gene mutation, transdifferentiation into small-cell lung cancer and additional rare or unkown mechanisms. Afatinib is a small molecule covalently binding and inhibiting the EGFR, HER2 and HER4 receptor tyrosine kinases. In preclinical studies, afatinib not only inhibited the growth of models with common activating EGFR mutations, but was also active in lung cancer models harboring wild-type EGFR or the EGFR L858R/T790M double mutant. Clinical efficacy of afatinib has been extensively studied in the LUX-Lung study program. These trials showed promising efficacy in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC or enriched for clinical benefit from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib or erlotinib. Here we review the current status of clinical application of afatinib in NSCLC.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Pendrin (SLC26A4), a transporter accomplishing anion exchange, is expressed in inner ear, thyroid gland, kidneys, lung, liver and heart. Loss or reduction of function mutations of SLC26A4 underlie Pendred syndrome, a disorder invariably leading to hearing loss with enlarged vestibular aqueducts and in some patients to hypothyroidism and goiter. Renal pendrin expression is up-regulated by mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone or deoxycorticosterone (DOCA). Little is known about the impact of mineralocorticoids on pendrin expression in extrarenal tissues. METHODS: The present study utilized RT-qPCR and Western blotting to quantify the transcript levels and protein abundance of Slc26a4 in murine kidney, thyroid, heart and lung prior to and following subcutaneous administration of 100 mg/kg DOCA. RESULTS: Slc26a4 transcript levels as compared to Gapdh transcript levels were significantly increased by DOCA treatment in kidney, heart, lung and thyroid. Accordingly pendrin protein expression was again significantly increased by DOCA treatment in kidney, heart, lung and thyroid.

Tonal audiometry showed bilateral sensorineural hearing loss in 87.5% of cases, and mixed hearing loss in 12.5% with bilateral high frequency sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss at lower frequencies. Deafness was severe in 21% and profound in 79% of cases. Thyroid goiter was found in 46.5% of cases. Inner ear CT scan found enlarged bilateral vestibular aqueducts in all cases. Hormone analysis was normal and perchlorate test negative in all cases. A single Pendred syndrome (PDS) gene mutation, L445W, was found.

The goal of the present study was to determine whether developmental delays, possibly mediated by systemic or local hypothyroidism, contribute to the failure to develop hearing in mice lacking Slc26a4 (Slc26a4(-/-)). We evaluated thyroid function by voltage and pH measurements, by array-assisted gene expression analysis, and by determination of plasma thyroxine levels. Cochlear development was evaluated for signs of hypothyroidism by microscopy, in situ hybridization, and quantitative RT-PCR. No differences in plasma thyroxine levels were found in Slc26a4(-/-) and sex-matched Slc26a4(+/-) littermates between postnatal day 5 (P5) and P90. In adult Slc26a4(-/-) mice, the transepithelial potential and the pH of thyroid follicles were reduced. No differences in the expression of genes that participate in thyroid hormone synthesis or ion transport were observed at P15, when plasma thyroxine levels peaked. Scala media of the cochlea was 10-fold enlarged, bulging into and thereby displacing fibrocytes, which express Dio2 to generate a cochlear thyroid hormone peak at P7. Cochlear development, including tunnel opening, arrival of efferent innervation at outer hair cells, endochondral and intramembraneous ossification, and developmental changes in the expression of Dio2, Dio3, and Tectb were delayed by 1-4 days. These data suggest that pendrin functions as a HCO3- transporter in the thyroid, that Slc26a4(-/-) mice are systemically euthyroid, and that delays in cochlear development, possibly due to local hypothyroidism, lead to the failure to develop hearing.',\n","  'qas': [{'id': '53148a07dae131f847000002_015',\n","    'is_impossible': False,\n","    'question': 'Which hormone abnormalities are characteristic to Pendred syndrome?',\n","    'answers': [{'text': 'thyroid', 'answer_start': 339}]}]},\n"," {'context': 'Genetic causes of goiter and deafness: Pendred syndrome in a girl and cooccurrence of Pendred syndrome and resistance to thyroid hormone in her sister.

For over 100 years after the first description of the disorder, the molecular pathology underlying the deafness and thyroid pathology in Pendred syndrome (PS) remained unknown. In 1997, early progress towards understanding the molecular basis of the disorder was made when we identified the PS gene and found it to belong to the SLC26 family of anion transporters. The realization that an anion transporter was responsible for these clinical features soon highlighted a potential role for pendrin in thyroid hormone biosynthesis. The role of pendrin in deafness, however, remained unclear. Our determination of its expression pattern in the inner ear along with the development of a mouse with a targeted disruption of the Slc26a4 gene has revealed that Slc26a4 is expressed in areas of the endolymphatic compartment known to play a role in endolymph reabsorption and that absence of this protein leads to a profound prenatal endolymphatic hydrops and destruction of many of the epithelial cells surrounding the scala media. The precise mechanisms underlying endolymph reabsorption in the inner ear are not yet known; these studies, however, provide some of the groundwork for allowing the future delineation of these processes.',\n","  'qas': [{'id': '53148a07dae131f847000002_032',\n","    'is_impossible': False,\n","    'question': 'Which hormone abnormalities are characteristic to Pendred syndrome?',\n","    'answers': [{'text': 'thyroid', 'answer_start': 196}]}]},\n"," {'context': 'Genetic factors that might lead to different responses in individuals exposed to perchlorate.

Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital deafness and thyroid goiter. The thyroid disease typically develops around puberty and is associated with a mild organification defect, characterized by an inappropriate discharge of iodide upon perchlorate stimulation (a positive perchlorate discharge test). The gene (PDS) mutated in Pendred syndrome is expressed in thyroid and encodes a 780-amino acid protein (pendrin) that has recently been shown to function as an iodide/chloride transporter. We sought to establish the location of pendrin in the thyroid and to examine the regulatory network controlling its synthesis. Using peptide-specific antibodies for immunolocalization studies, pendrin was detected in a limited subset of cells within the thyroid follicles, exclusively at the apical membrane of the follicular epithelium. Interestingly, significantly greater amounts of pendrin were encountered in thyroid tissue from patients with Graves' disease. Using a cultured rat thyroid cell line (FRTL-5), PDS expression was found to be significantly induced by low concentrations of thyroglobulin (TG), but not by TSH, sodium iodide, or insulin. This is different from the established effect of TG, more typically a potent suppressor of thyroid-specific gene expression. Together, these results suggest that pendrin is an apical porter of iodide in the thyroid and that the expression and function of both the apical and basal iodide porters are coordinately regulated by follicular TG.\",\n","  'qas': [{'id': '53148a07dae131f847000002_045',\n","    'is_impossible': False,\n","    'question': 'Which hormone abnormalities are characteristic to Pendred syndrome?',\n","    'answers': [{'text': 'thyroid', 'answer_start': 254}]}]},\n"," {'context': 'Molecular analysis of the PDS gene in Pendred syndrome.

We performed mutation analysis of individual exons of the PDS gene in one Spanish family that shows intrafamilial variability of the deafness phenotype (two patients with profound and one with moderate-severe deafness). We identified a new splice-site mutation affecting intron 4 of the PDS gene, at nucleotide position 639+7. RNA analysis from lymphocytes of the affected patients showed that mutation 639+7A-->G generates a new donor splice site, leading to an mRNA with an insertion of six nucleotides from intron 4 of PDS.

METHODS: The present study utilized RT-qPCR and Western blotting to quantify the transcript levels and protein abundance of Slc26a4 in murine kidney, thyroid, heart and lung prior to and following subcutaneous administration of 100 mg/kg DOCA. RESULTS: Slc26a4 transcript levels as compared to Gapdh transcript levels were significantly increased by DOCA treatment in kidney, heart, lung and thyroid.

Neuroblastoma is one of the most genomically heterogeneous childhood malignances studied to date, and the molecular events that occur during the course of the disease are not fully understood. Genomic studies in neuroblastoma have showed only a few recurrent mutations and a low somatic mutation burden. However, none of these studies has examined the mutations arising during the course of disease, nor have they systemically examined the expression of mutant genes. Here we performed genomic analyses on tumors taken during a 3.5 years disease course from a neuroblastoma patient (bone marrow biopsy at diagnosis, adrenal primary tumor taken at surgical resection, and a liver metastasis at autopsy). Whole genome sequencing of the index liver metastasis identified 44 non-synonymous somatic mutations in 42 genes (0.85 mutation/MB) and a large hemizygous deletion in the ATRX gene which has been recently reported in neuroblastoma. Of these 45 somatic alterations, 15 were also detected in the primary tumor and bone marrow biopsy, while the other 30 were unique to the index tumor, indicating accumulation of de novo mutations during therapy. Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing on the 3 tumors demonstrated only 3 out of the 15 commonly mutated genes (LPAR1, GATA2, and NUFIP1) had high level of expression of the mutant alleles, suggesting potential oncogenic driver roles of these mutated genes.

A common goal of tumor sequencing projects is finding genes whose mutations are selected for during tumor development. This is accomplished by choosing genes that have more non-synonymous mutations than expected from an estimated background mutation frequency. While this background frequency is unknown, it can be estimated using both the observed synonymous mutation frequency and the non-synonymous to synonymous mutation ratio. The synonymous mutation frequency can be determined across all genes or in a gene-specific manner. This choice introduces an interesting trade-off. A gene-specific frequency adjusts for an underlying mutation bias, but is difficult to estimate given missing synonymous mutation counts. Using a genome-wide synonymous frequency is more robust, but is less suited for adjusting biases. Studying four evaluation criteria for identifying genes with high non-synonymous mutation burden (reflecting preferential selection of expressed genes, genes with mutations in conserved bases, genes with many protein interactions, and genes that show loss of heterozygosity), we find that the gene-specific synonymous frequency is superior in the gene expression and protein interaction tests.

An ESR study. Doxorubicin is a potent cytostatic drug which is applied for the treatment of various kinds of malignant diseases. In spite of the routine use of this drug its major adverse effect, the dose-dependent cardiotoxicity, cannot be prevented yet. However, several clinical trials indicated that iron chelators are able to moderate the noxious effect more efficiently than radical scavenging antioxidants. This in turn supports the idea that doxorubicin-iron complexes are involved in triggering the cardiotoxicity of this drug by catalyzing the formation of oxygen radicals. However, both the mode of generation of doxorubicin-iron complexes and the consequences in vivo are not understood so far. In order to figure out whether or not doxorubicin can utilize iron from the transport protein transferrin for complex formation and prooxidative activities we studied the redox state of iron and its regulatory control by ceruloplasmin and ascorbate in the plasma of dogs suffering from malignant lymphoma by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The respective electron spin resonance intensities prior to and after treatment with doxorubicin were compared with those from healthy controls. Our results revealed that dogs with lymphoma exhibit lower levels of paramagnetic copper in ceruloplasmin (-22%) and iron in transferrin (-33%) than healthy animals. Likewise the concentration of ascorbate radicals was lower in patients with lymphoma than in healthy subjects. The decreased cupric state of ceruloplasmin is equivalent to a diminished ferroxidase activity in plasma and therefore indicates indirectly an impaired antioxidant activity in these patients. Administration of doxorubicin in vivo further reduced the concentration of paramagnetic copper (-18%) and iron (-13%) while the concentration of ascorbate radicals remained unchanged. This decrease was also seen during the in vitro incubation of plasma with doxorubicin suggesting a direct interaction of the drug with the paramagnetic metal species. Model experiments revealed that the effect is based on a doxorubicin-induced release of iron from transferrin which is enhanced by ascorbate and the subsequent formation of doxorubicin-iron complexes. This mechanism was shown to trigger the formation of hydroxyl radicals from H(2)O(2) and to cause an oxidation of the antioxidant ceruloplasmin. Our data demonstrate that cardiotoxic doxorubicin-iron complexes are not only formed in cardiomyocytes itself as generally assumed, but are also present in the circulation. Therefore, these findings provide an additional rationale for potential benefit of iron chelators during doxorubicin chemotherapy.',\n","  'qas': [{'id': '53551206a0726bee57000001_004',\n","    'is_impossible': False,\n","    'question': 'What is the major adverse effect of adriamycin(doxorubicin)?',\n","    'answers': [{'text': 'cardiotoxicity', 'answer_start': 319}]}]},\n"," {'context': 'Antioxidative and cardioprotective effects of Phyllanthus urinaria L. on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.

Heart failure is one of the leading causes of sudden death in developed countries. While current therapies are mostly aimed at mitigating associated symptoms, novel therapies targeting the subcellular mechanisms underlying heart failure are emerging. Failing hearts are characterized by reduced contractile properties caused by impaired Ca(2+) cycling between the sarcoplasm and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Sarcoplasmic/ endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) mediates Ca(2+) reuptake into the SR in cardiomyocytes. Of note, the expression level and/or activity of SERCA2a, translating to the quantity of SR Ca(2+) uptake, are significantly reduced in failing hearts. Normalization of the SERCA2a expression level by gene delivery has been shown to restore hampered cardiac functions and ameliorate associated symptoms in pre-clinical as well as clinical studies. SERCA2a activity can be regulated at multiple levels of a signaling cascade comprised of phospholamban, protein phosphatase 1, inhibitor-1, and PKCα.

In the current study, we determined that HAX-1 can also bind to SERCA2. Deletion mapping analysis demonstrated that amino acid residues 575-594 of SERCA2's nucleotide binding domain are required for its interaction with the C-terminal domain of HAX-1, containing amino acids 203-245.

Overexpression of SERCA2 abrogated the protective effects of HAX-1 on cell survival, after hypoxia/reoxygenation or thapsigargin treatment. Importantly, HAX-1 overexpression was associated with down-regulation of SERCA2 expression levels, resulting in significant reduction of apparent ER Ca(2+) levels.

BACKGROUND: Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica Bazex (APB) is a very rare disease in the group of obligate paraneoplastic dermatoses, associated mostly with squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract and metastatic cervical lymphadenopathy. The disease is characterized by violaceous erythemosquamous changes on the acral regions. This entity was first reported by Bazex in 1965. About 160 cases have been presented so far. CASE REPORT: We presented a patient with a three-month history of violaceous erythema, edema, erosions and scaling on the acral regions, elbows and knees and severe nail dystrophy. When the diagnosis was established, he did not have any symptom of internal malignancy. Esophagogastroscopy revealed ulcerovegetant lesion of the esophagus, while histology showed squamocellular invasive carcinoma. Surgical tumor removal resulted in significant improvement of skin changes in 15 days. Unfortunately, four months later, extensive skin lesions pointed to metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma. CONCLUSION: Skin changes can precede a few years the first manifestations of neoplasia. The course of the disease in our patient proved that APB is a specific marker of underlying malignancy.',\n","  'qas': [{'id': '56bc751eac7ad10019000013_005',\n","    'is_impossible': False,\n","    'question': 'Name synonym of Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica.',\n","    'answers': [{'text': 'Bazex syndrome', 'answer_start': 30}]}]},\n"," {'context': 'Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica (Bazex syndrome) with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.

The focus of this article is acrokeratosis paraneoplastica, one of two disorders that have acquired the eponym Bazex syndrome. To date, all of the patients reported in the literature have had an underlying neoplasm, most commonly squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract. In this review of 113 cases of acrokeratosis paraneoplastica (mean age, 61 years; 105 males, 8 females), the psoriasiform lesions preceded the diagnosis of the associated malignancy in 73 (67%) of 109 patients, whereas the cutaneous manifestations followed the diagnosis of the neoplasm in only 16 (15%) of 109; in the remainder, the onset of the skin lesions and the diagnosis of the tumor occurred simultaneously. Therefore, awareness of the cutaneous signs of Bazex syndrome is of obvious importance to dermatologists. Evidence in favor of the paraneoplastic nature of this disease is as follows: in 81 (93%) of 87 patients with adequate clinical descriptions, the skin lesions either improved significantly (or resolved) when the underlying neoplasm was treated or they remained unchanged in the setting of persistent disease. Occasionally, the reappearance of skin lesions has signaled a recurrence of the tumor.',\n","  'qas': [{'id': '56bc751eac7ad10019000013_008',\n","    'is_impossible': False,\n","    'question': 'Name synonym of Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica.',\n","    'answers': [{'text': 'Bazex syndrome', 'answer_start': 0}]}]},\n"," {'context': \"Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica (Bazex syndrome) presenting in a patient with metastatic breast carcinoma: possible etiologic role of zinc.

OBJECTIVE: The objectives of our article are (1) to describe a unique case of acrokeratosis paraneoplastica and (2) to review the current literature regarding skin findings, commonly associated neoplasms, and treatment options relative to this condition. PATIENT: We describe a 68-year-old female with lobular breast carcinoma, complicated by local and distant recurrences, who presented with a 1-year history of prominent acral skin and nail changes. RESULTS: Our patient's clinical skin findings improved significantly following treatment and partial remission of her underlying malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient represents one of few females described with this syndrome, which is especially rare in association with lobular breast carcinoma. Further, the patient's presentation is unique as she was discovered to demonstrate laboratory findings consistent with coexistent porphyria cutanea tarda and relative zinc deficiency.\",\n","  'qas': [{'id': '56bc751eac7ad10019000013_011',\n","    'is_impossible': False,\n","    'question': 'Name synonym of Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica.',\n","    'answers': [{'text': 'Bazex syndrome', 'answer_start': 150}]}]},\n"," {'context': 'Orteronel plus prednisone in patients with chemotherapy-naive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (ELM-PC 4): a double-blind, multicentre, phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.

We assessed orteronel in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. METHODS: In this phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and no previous chemotherapy from 324 study centres (ie, hospitals or large urologic or group outpatient offices) in 43 countries. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 400 mg orteronel plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily or placebo plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily. Randomisation was done centrally with an interactive voice response system and patients were stratified by region (Europe, North America, and not Europe or North America) and the presence or absence of radiographic disease progression at baseline. The two primary endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival, determined in the intention-to-treat population.

RESULTS: The study was unblinded after crossing a prespecified OS futility boundary. The median OS was 17.0 months versus 15.2 months with orteronel-prednisone versus placebo-prednisone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.886; 95% CI, 0.739 to 1.062; P = .190). Improved rPFS was observed with orteronel-prednisone (median, 8.3 v 5.7 months; HR, 0.760; 95% CI, 0.653 to 0.885; P < .001). Orteronel-prednisone showed advantages over placebo-prednisone in PSA50 rate (25% v 10%, P < .001) and time to PSA progression (median, 5.5 v 2.9 months, P < .001) but not pain response rate (12% v 9%; P = .128). Adverse events (all grades) were generally more frequent with orteronel-prednisone, including nausea (42% v 26%), vomiting (36% v 17%), fatigue (29% v 23%), and increased amylase (14% v 2%). CONCLUSION: Our study did not meet the primary end point of OS.

BACKGROUND: Orteronel is an investigational, partially selective inhibitor of CYP 17,20-lyase in the androgen signalling pathway, a validated therapeutic target for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We assessed orteronel in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. METHODS: In this phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and no previous chemotherapy from 324 study centres (ie, hospitals or large urologic or group outpatient offices) in 43 countries. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 400 mg orteronel plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily or placebo plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily. Randomisation was done centrally with an interactive voice response system and patients were stratified by region (Europe, North America, and not Europe or North America) and the presence or absence of radiographic disease progression at baseline. The two primary endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival, determined in the intention-to-treat population.

The clinical cutoff date for the final analysis was Jan 15, 2014 (with 611 deaths). Median follow-up for radiographic progression-free survival was 8·4 months (IQR 3·7-16·6). Median radiographic progression-free survival was 13·8 months (95% CI 13·1-14·9) with orteronel plus prednisone and 8·7 months (8·3-10·9) with placebo plus prednisone (hazard ratio [HR] 0·71, 95% CI 0·63-0·80; p<0·0001). After a median follow-up of 20·7 months (IQR 14·2-25·4), median overall survival was 31·4 months (95% CI 28·6-not estimable) with orteronel plus prednisone and 29·5 months (27·0-not estimable) with placebo plus prednisone (HR 0·92, 95% CI 0·79-1·08; p=0·31). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were increased lipase (137 [17%] of 784 patients in the orteronel plus prednisone group vs 14 [2%] of 770 patients in the placebo plus prednisone group), increased amylase (77 [10%] vs nine [1%]), fatigue (50 [6%] vs 14 [2%]), and pulmonary embolism (40 [5%] vs 27 [4%]).

Orteronel (TAK-700) is an investigational, oral, nonsteroidal, selective, reversible inhibitor of 17,20-lyase, a key enzyme in the production of androgenic hormones. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a phase I/II study in men with progressive, chemotherapy-naïve, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and serum testosterone <50 ng/dL. In the phase I part, patients received orteronel 100 to 600 mg twice daily or 400 mg twice a day plus prednisone 5 mg twice a day. In phase II, patients received orteronel 300 mg twice a day, 400 mg twice a day plus prednisone, 600 mg twice a day plus prednisone, or 600 mg once a day without prednisone. RESULTS: In phase I (n = 26), no dose-limiting toxicities were observed and 13 of 20 evaluable patients (65%) achieved > 50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline from baseline at 12 weeks. In phase II (n = 97), 45 of 84 evaluable patients (54%) achieved a > 50% decline in PSA and at 12 weeks, substantial mean reductions from baseline in testosterone (-7.5 ng/dL) and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (-45.3 μg/dL) were observed. Unconfirmed partial responses were reported in 10 of 51 evaluable phase II patients (20%). Decreases in circulating tumor cells were documented. Fifty-three percent of phase II patients experienced grade > 3 adverse events irrespective of causality; most common were fatigue, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and diarrhea.

The clinical cutoff date for the final analysis was Jan 15, 2014 (with 611 deaths). Median follow-up for radiographic progression-free survival was 8·4 months (IQR 3·7-16·6). Median radiographic progression-free survival was 13·8 months (95% CI 13·1-14·9) with orteronel plus prednisone and 8·7 months (8·3-10·9) with placebo plus prednisone (hazard ratio [HR] 0·71, 95% CI 0·63-0·80; p<0·0001). After a median follow-up of 20·7 months (IQR 14·2-25·4), median overall survival was 31·4 months (95% CI 28·6-not estimable) with orteronel plus prednisone and 29·5 months (27·0-not estimable) with placebo plus prednisone (HR 0·92, 95% CI 0·79-1·08; p=0·31). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were increased lipase (137 [17%] of 784 patients in the orteronel plus prednisone group vs 14 [2%] of 770 patients in the placebo plus prednisone group), increased amylase (77 [10%] vs nine [1%]), fatigue (50 [6%] vs 14 [2%]), and pulmonary embolism (40 [5%] vs 27 [4%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 358 [46%] patients receiving orteronel plus prednisone and in 292 [38%] patients receiving placebo plus prednisone. INTERPRETATION: In chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, radiographic progression-free survival was prolonged with orteronel plus prednisone versus placebo plus prednisone. However, no improvement was noted in the other primary endpoint, overall survival. Orteronel plus prednisone was associated with increased toxic effects compared with placebo plus prednisone. On the basis of these and other data, orteronel is not undergoing further development in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

PURPOSE: Orteronel (TAK-700) is a non-steroidal, selective, reversible inhibitor of 17,20-lyase. We evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor effect of orteronel with or without prednisolone in Japanese patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 study in men with progressive and chemotherapy-naïve CRPC. Patients received orteronel orally at doses of 200-400 mg twice daily (BID) with or without oral prednisolone (5 mg BID). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was assessed during Cycle 1 (28 days). Patients could continue study treatment until any of criteria for treatment discontinuation were met. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy was continued in patients without prior orchidectomy. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were enrolled and administered at least one dose of orteronel. No DLTs were reported during Cycle 1 in this study. Adverse events (AEs) were reported in all 15 patients. Most common AEs (>30%) were hyperlipasemia (47%), hyperamylasemia (40%), and constipation (33%). Acute pancreatitis (Grades 2 and 3) and pancreatitis (Grade 1) were complicated in three patients during the study. Dose-dependent increase in plasma orteronel concentrations was indicated over the 200-400 mg BID dose range. Prednisolone coadministered did not alter PK of orteronel. Serum testosterone was rapidly suppressed below the lower limit of quantification across all doses. Of 15 subjects, 13 achieved at least a 50% reduction from baseline in prostate-specific antigen.

Orteronel is a nonsteroidal, selective inhibitor of 17,20-lyase that was recently in phase 3 clinical development as a treatment for castration-resistant prostate cancer. In humans, the primary clearance route for orteronel is renal excretion. Human liver microsomal studies indicated that orteronel weakly inhibits CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19, with IC50 values of 17.8, 27.7, 30.8 and 38.8 µm, respectively, whereas orteronel does not inhibit CYP2B6, 2D6 or 3A4/5 (IC50 > 100 µm). Orteronel also does not exhibit time-dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 or 3A4/5. The results of a static model indicated an [I]/Ki ratio >0.1 for CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19. Therefore, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to assess the potential for drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between orteronel and theophylline, repaglinide, (S)-warfarin and omeprazole, which are sensitive substrates of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19, respectively. Simulation of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of these four CYP substrates in the presence and absence of orteronel revealed geometric mean AUC ratios <1.25. Therefore, in accordance with the 2012 US FDA Draft Guidance on DDIs, orteronel can be labeled a 'non-inhibitor' and further clinical DDI evaluation is not required. In PBPK models of moderate and severe renal impairment, the AUC of orteronel was predicted to increase by 52% and 83%, respectively.

Orteronel (TAK-700) is an investigational, oral, nonsteroidal, selective, reversible inhibitor of 17,20-lyase, a key enzyme in the production of androgenic hormones. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a phase I/II study in men with progressive, chemotherapy-naïve, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and serum testosterone <50 ng/dL.

The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were increased lipase (137 [17%] of 784 patients in the orteronel plus prednisone group vs 14 [2%] of 770 patients in the placebo plus prednisone group), increased amylase (77 [10%] vs nine [1%]), fatigue (50 [6%] vs 14 [2%]), and pulmonary embolism (40 [5%] vs 27 [4%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 358 [46%] patients receiving orteronel plus prednisone and in 292 [38%] patients receiving placebo plus prednisone. INTERPRETATION: In chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, radiographic progression-free survival was prolonged with orteronel plus prednisone versus placebo plus prednisone. However, no improvement was noted in the other primary endpoint, overall survival. Orteronel plus prednisone was associated with increased toxic effects compared with placebo plus prednisone. On the basis of these and other data, orteronel is not undergoing further development in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Here, we describe trafficking and subcellular localizations of exogenous Panx2 and Panx1 protein expression in MDCK, HeLa, and HEK 293T cells as well as endogenous Panx1 and Panx2 patterns in the CNS. Panx2 was found in intracellular localizations, was partially N-glycosylated, and localizations were non-overlapping with Panx1. Confocal images of hippocampal sections immunolabeled for the astrocytic protein GFAP, Panx1 and Panx2 demonstrated that the two isoforms, Panx1 and Panx2, localized at different subcellular compartments in both astrocytes and neurons. Using recombinant fusions of Panx2 with appended genetic tags developed for correlated light and electron microscopy and then expressed in different cell lines, we determined that Panx2 is localized in the membrane of intracellular vesicles and not in the endoplasmic reticulum as initially indicated by calnexin colocalization experiments. Dual immunofluorescence imaging with protein markers for specific vesicle compartments showed that Panx2 vesicles are early endosomal in origin. In electron tomographic volumes, cross-sections of these vesicles displayed fine structural details and close proximity to actin filaments.

Diagnosis of the condition depends primarily on clinical features, biochemical parameters and the presence of the Kayser-Fleischer ring, and a new diagnostic scoring system has recently been proposed. Mutations in ATP7B can occur anywhere along the entire 21 exons, which makes the identification of gene defects particularly challenging. Identification of carriers and presymptomatic family members of affected individuals is achieved by polymerase-chain-reaction-based marker analysis. The traditional treatment for WD is based on copper chelation with agents such as D-penicillamine, but use of this drug has been questioned because of reported side effects. The use of agents such as trientine and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate has been advocated, although results of long-term trials are awaited. In selected cases, orthotropic hepatic transplantation can reverse the basic metabolic abnormality in WD and improve both hepatic and neurological symptoms.

The manifestation of Wilson's disease is usually hepatic or neurologic. Hepatic form is manifested by acute or chronic hepatitis, steatosis or cirrhosis. Neurologic involvement is manifested usually after 20 year of age by motor disturbances (tremor, disturbed speech, problems with writing), which could progress into severe extrapyramidal syndrome with tremor, rigidity, dysartria, dysfagia and muscle contracture. Diagnosis is based on clinical and laboratory examinations (neurologic symptoms, liver disease, low serum ceruloplasmin levels, elevated free copper concentration in serum, high urine copper excretion, and presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings). Confirmation of diagnosis is done by hepatic copper concentration in liver biopsy or by genetic examination. Untreated disease leads to the death of a patient. Treatment is based on chelating agents decreasing the copper content by excretion into urine (D-penicillamine, trientine) or on agents preventing absorption of copper from food (zinc, ammonium-tetrahiomolybdene). Patients with asymptomatic Wilson's disease have to be treated as well. In Czech Republic either penicillamine or zinc are used.

Magnetic resonance imaging results of brain were negative. Even so, the authors argued in favor of a diagnosis of Hallervorden-Spatz disease because the cases fulfilled the clinical criteria for diagnosis of this disease. Apart from the negative magnetic resonance findings, the other unusual feature was the early development of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Few conditions need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of a childhood-onset rapidly progressive extrapyramidal syndrome. Such conditions include Wilson\\'s disease, Hallervorden-Spatz disease (HSD), juvenile form of Huntington\\'s disease, juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, early-onset Machado-Joseph disease neuroacanthocytosis, storage disorders, and variant form of dopa-response dystonias (DRD). Rarer conditions are Leigh\\'s disease, Lafora body disease, and dentato-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy. HSD is a rare disorder characterized by progressive extrapyramidal dysfunction and dementia. Onset is most commonly in late childhood or early adolescence. The disease can be familial or sporadic. When familial, it is inherited recessively and has been linked to chromosome 20. Recently, a mutation in the pantothenate kinase (PANK2) gene on band 20pl3 has been described in patients with typical HSD. HSD produces typical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in brain, aiding in antemortem diagnosis. The typical finding is of bilaterally symmetrical hyperintense signal changes in the external segment of globus pallidus, with surrounding hypointensity on T(2)-weighted image. These imaging features are fairly diagnostic and have been termed the \"eye-of-the tiger sign\". The hyperintensity represents pathologic changes, including gliosis, demyelination, neuronal loss, and axonal swelling, and the surrounding hypointensity is caused by loss of signal secondary to iron deposition.

According to the Brooke functional scale, 20% of our patients were graded as 1, 30% as grade 2, and 50% as grade 3. On the Vignos functional scale, 50% of patients fell into grade 1, 10% in grade 2, and 40% in grades 3-5. Vignos scale was significantly correlated with mean muscle strength (p < 0.05). The average value of Barthel index was 97.8 +/- 4.7. The muscle strength decline in this Taiwanese of FSHD population was more severe in shoulder girdle area. The mean muscle strength of the right extremity was weaker than the left. Most of our patients suffered from mild or moderate physical disability.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of treatment with SA prior to hyperthermia on the thermosensitivity of DU145 cells, and the mechanisms related to the induction of apoptosis and G(2)/M cell cycle arrest via the activation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, as well as the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways. Cells were exposed to hyperthermia alone (40-44˚C) or hyperthermia in combination with SA. Lethal damage to cells treated with mild hyperthermia (40 or 42˚C) for up to 6 h was slight; however, hyperthermia in combination with SA synergistically enhanced thermosensivity. Lethal damage to cells treated with acute hyperthermia (43 or 44˚C) was more severe, but these effects were also enhanced and were more significant by the combined treatment with SA. The kinetics of apoptosis induction and cell cycle distribution were analyzed by flow cytometry. In addition, the levels of ERK1/2, JNK and Akt were determined by western blot analysis. The incidence of apoptotic cells after treatment with SA (20.0 µM) at 37˚C for 4 h, hyperthermia (44˚C) alone for 30 min, and the combination in sequence were examined.

RESULTS: SK-MEL-3, a cell line established from metastatic MM, showed slightly increased phosphorylation of both JNK1 and JNK2, whereas WM164, a cell line derived from primary MM, showed significant phosphorylation of JNK1.

Cerebellar granule cell (CGC) apoptosis by trophic/potassium (TK) deprivation is a model of election to study the interplay of pro-apoptotic and pro-survival signaling pathways in neuronal cell death. In this model, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) induces pro-apoptotic genes through the c-Jun/activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor. On the other side, a survival pathway initiated by lithium leads to repression of pro-apoptotic c-Jun/AP-1 target genes without interfering with JNK activity. Yet, the mechanism by which lithium inhibits c-Jun activity remains to be elucidated. Here, we used this model system to study the regulation and function of site-specific c-Jun phosphorylation at the S63 and T91/T93 JNK sites in neuronal cell death. We found that TK-deprivation led to c-Jun multiphosphorylation at all three JNK sites. However, immunofluorescence analysis of c-Jun phosphorylation at single cell level revealed that the S63 site was phosphorylated in all c-Jun-expressing cells, whereas the response of T91/T93 phosphorylation was more sensitive, mirroring the switch-like apoptotic response of CGCs. Conversely, lithium prevented T91T93 phosphorylation and cell death without affecting the S63 site, suggesting that T91T93 phosphorylation triggers c-Jun pro-apoptotic activity. Accordingly, a c-Jun mutant lacking the T95 priming site for T91/93 phosphorylation protected CGCs from apoptosis, whereas it was able to induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Vice versa, a c-Jun mutant bearing aspartate substitution of T95 overwhelmed lithium-mediate protection of CGCs from TK-deprivation, validating that inhibition of T91/T93/T95 phosphorylation underlies the effect of lithium on cell death. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed multiphosphorylation of c-Jun at T91/T93/T95 in cells. Moreover, JNK phosphorylated recombinant c-Jun at T91/T93 in a T95-dependent manner.

In this report, we studied the detailed mechanism of RANTES/CCL5 induction in primary human astrocytes activated with IL-1 and IFNbeta. Ribonuclease protection assay and ELISA showed that IFNbeta, although not effective alone, increased IL-1-induced RANTES/CCL5 expression, but did not antagonize IFNgamma. IL-1 or IL-1/IFNbeta-induced RANTES/CCL5 expression was inhibited by the super-repressor IkappaBalpha or inhibitors of p38 or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases), but not by extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERK) inhibitors. IFNbeta enhanced IL-1-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, but was not effective alone.

Activation of the JNK pathway has been implicated in the formation of several human tumors. We have previously demonstrated that a 55-kDa JNK isoform is constitutively activated in 86% of human brain tumors and more recently demonstrated that this isoform is either JNK2alpha2 or JNK2beta2. Importantly, we have also found that among the 10 known JNK isoforms, the JNK2 isoforms are unique in their ability to autophosphorylate in vitro and in vivo. This does not require the participation of any upstream kinases and also leads to substrate kinase activity in vitro and in vivo. To clarify the mechanism of JNK2alpha2 autoactivation, we have generated a series of chimeric cDNAs joining portions of JNK1alpha2, which does not have detectable autophosphorylation activity, with portions of JNK2alpha2, which has the strongest autophosphorylation activity. Through in vivo and in vitro kinase assays, we were able to define a domain ranging from amino acids 218 to 226 within JNK2alpha2 that is required for its autophosphorylation. Mutation of JNK2alpha2 to its counterpart of JNK1alpha2 in this region abrogated the autophosphorylation activity and c-Jun substrate kinase activity in vivo and in vitro. Notably, switching of JNK1alpha2 to JNK2alpha2 at this 9-amino acid site enabled JNK1alpha2 to gain the autophosphorylation activity in vivo and in vitro. We also found two other functional sites that participate in JNK2alpha2 activity. One site ranging from amino acids 363 to 382 of JNK2alpha2 is required for efficient c-Jun binding in vitro, and a site ranging from amino acids 383 to 424 enhances autophosphorylation intensity, although it is not required for triggering the autophosphorylation in vitro. These findings have uncovered the regions required for JNK2alpha2 autophosphorylation, and this information could be used as potential targets to block JNK2alpha2 activation.',\n","  'qas': [{'id': '5518e7da622b194345000004_013',\n","    'is_impossible': False,\n","    'question': 'Which MAP kinase phosphorylates the transcription factor c-jun?',\n","    'answers': [{'text': 'JNK', 'answer_start': 110}]}]},\n"," {'context': 'Phosphorylation of c-Fos by members of the p38 MAPK family. Role in the AP-1 response to UV light. Exposure to sources of UV radiation, such as sunlight, induces a number of cellular alterations that are highly dependent on its ability to affect gene expression. Among them, the rapid activation of genes coding for two subfamilies of proto-oncoproteins, Fos and Jun, which constitute the AP-1 transcription factor, plays a key role in the subsequent regulation of expression of genes involved in DNA repair, cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, death by apoptosis, and tissue and extracellular matrix remodeling proteases. Besides being regulated at the transcriptional level, Jun and Fos transcriptional activities are also regulated by phosphorylation as a result of the activation of intracellular signaling cascades. In this regard, the phosphorylation of c-Jun by UV-induced JNK has been readily documented, whereas a role for Fos proteins in UV-mediated responses and the identification of Fos-activating kinases has remained elusive. Here we identify p38 MAPKs as proteins that can associate with c-Fos and phosphorylate its transactivation domain both in vitro and in vivo. This phosphorylation is transduced into changes in its transcriptional ability as p38-activated c-Fos enhances AP1-driven gene expression. Our findings indicate that as a consequence of the activation of stress pathways induced by UV light, endogenous c-Fos becomes a substrate of p38 MAPKs and, for the first time, provide evidence that support a critical role for p38 MAPKs in mediating stress-induced c-Fos phosphorylation and gene transcription activation. Using a specific pharmacological inhibitor for p38alpha and -beta, we found that most likely these two isoforms mediate UV-induced c-Fos phosphorylation in vivo. Thus, these newly described pathways act concomitantly with the activation of c-Jun by JNK/MAPKs, thereby contributing to the complexity of AP1-driven gene transcription regulation.',\n","  'qas': [{'id': '5518e7da622b194345000004_014',\n","    'is_impossible': False,\n","    'question': 'Which MAP kinase phosphorylates the transcription factor c-jun?',\n","    'answers': [{'text': 'JNK', 'answer_start': 883}]}]},\n"," {'context': 'c-Jun-mediated anticancer mechanisms of tylophorine.

Ewing sarcoma is the second most common bone malignancy in children and young adults. It is driven by oncogenic fusion proteins (i.e. EWS/FLI1) acting as aberrant transcription factors that upregulate and downregulate target genes, leading to cellular transformation. Thus, identificating these target genes and understanding their contribution to Ewing sarcoma tumorigenesis are key for the development of new therapeutic strategies. In this study we show that lysyl oxidase (LOX), an enzyme involved in maintaining structural integrity of the extracellular matrix, is downregulated by the EWS/FLI1 oncoprotein and in consequence it is not expressed in Ewing sarcoma cells and primary tumors. Using a doxycycline inducible system to restore LOX expression in an Ewing sarcoma derived cell line, we showed that LOX displays tumor suppressor activities. Interestingly, we showed that the tumor suppressor activity resides in the propeptide domain of LOX (LOX-PP), an N-terminal domain produced by proteolytic cleavage during the physiological processing of LOX. Expression of LOX-PP reduced cell proliferation, cell migration, anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and formation of tumors in immunodeficient mice. By contrast, the C-terminal domain of LOX, which contains the enzymatic activity, had the opposite effects, corroborating that the tumor suppressor activity of LOX is mediated exclusively by its propeptide domain. Finally, we showed that LOX-PP inhibits ERK/MAPK signalling pathway, and that many pathways involved in cell cycle progression were significantly deregulated by LOX-PP, providing a mechanistic explanation to the cell proliferation inhibition observed upon LOX-PP expression. In summary, our observations indicate that deregulation of the LOX gene participates in Ewing sarcoma development and identify LOX-PP as a new therapeutic target for one of the most aggressive paediatric malignancies. These findings suggest that therapeutic strategies based on the administration of LOX propeptide or functional analogues could be useful for the treatment of this devastating paediatric cancer.',\n","  'qas': [{'id': '552fac4fbc4f83e828000006_001',\n","    'is_impossible': False,\n","    'question': 'Which fusion protein is involved in the development of Ewing sarcoma?',\n","    'answers': [{'text': 'EWS/FLI1', 'answer_start': 279}]}]},\n"," {'context': \"EWS/FLI1 regulates EYA3 in Ewing sarcoma via modulation of miRNA-708, resulting in increased cell survival and chemoresistance. Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive pediatric cancer of the bone and soft tissue, in which patients whose tumors have a poor histologic response to initial chemotherapy have a poor overall prognosis. Therefore, it is important to identify molecules involved in resistance to chemotherapy. Herein, we show that the DNA repair protein and transcriptional cofactor, EYA3, is highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma tumor samples and cell lines compared with mesenchymal stem cells, the presumed cell-of-origin of Ewing sarcoma, and that it is regulated by the EWS/FLI1 fusion protein transcription factor. We further show that EWS/FLI1 mediates upregulation of EYA3 via repression of miR-708, a miRNA that targets the EYA3 3'-untranslated region, rather than by binding the EYA3 promoter directly. Importantly, we show that high levels of EYA3 significantly correlate with low levels of miR-708 in Ewing sarcoma samples, suggesting that this miR-mediated mechanism of EYA3 regulation holds true in human cancers. Because EYA proteins are important for cell survival during development, we examine, and show, that loss of EYA3 decreases survival of Ewing sarcoma cells. Most importantly, knockdown of EYA3 in Ewing sarcoma cells leads to sensitization to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics used in the treatment of Ewing sarcoma, and as expected, after chemotherapeutic treatment, EYA3 knockdown cells repair DNA damage less effectively than their control counterparts.

Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive pediatric cancer of the bone and soft tissue, in which patients whose tumors have a poor histologic response to initial chemotherapy have a poor overall prognosis. Therefore, it is important to identify molecules involved in resistance to chemotherapy. Herein, we show that the DNA repair protein and transcriptional cofactor, EYA3, is highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma tumor samples and cell lines compared with mesenchymal stem cells, the presumed cell-of-origin of Ewing sarcoma, and that it is regulated by the EWS/FLI1 fusion protein transcription factor. We further show that EWS/FLI1 mediates upregulation of EYA3 via repression of miR-708, a miRNA that targets the EYA3 3'-untranslated region, rather than by binding the EYA3 promoter directly. Importantly, we show that high levels of EYA3 significantly correlate with low levels of miR-708 in Ewing sarcoma samples, suggesting that this miR-mediated mechanism of EYA3 regulation holds true in human cancers. Because EYA proteins are important for cell survival during development, we examine, and show, that loss of EYA3 decreases survival of Ewing sarcoma cells. Most importantly, knockdown of EYA3 in Ewing sarcoma cells leads to sensitization to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics used in the treatment of Ewing sarcoma, and as expected, after chemotherapeutic treatment, EYA3 knockdown cells repair DNA damage less effectively than their control counterparts. These studies identify EYA3 as a novel mediator of chemoresistance in Ewing sarcoma and define the molecular mechanisms of both EYA3 overexpression and of EYA3-mediated chemoresistance.\",\n","  'qas': [{'id': '552fac4fbc4f83e828000006_008',\n","    'is_impossible': False,\n","    'question': 'Which fusion protein is involved in the development of Ewing sarcoma?',\n","    'answers': [{'text': 'EWS/FLI1', 'answer_start': 674}]}]},\n"," {'context': 'Ewing sarcoma EWS protein regulates midzone formation by recruiting Aurora B kinase to the midzone. Ewing sarcoma is a malignant bone cancer that primarily occurs in children and adolescents. Eighty-five percent of Ewing sarcoma is characterized by the presence of the aberrant chimeric EWS/FLI1 fusion gene. Previously, we demonstrated that an interaction between EWS/FLI1 and wild-type EWS led to the inhibition of EWS activity and mitotic dysfunction. Although defective mitosis is considered to be a critical step in cancer initiation, it is unknown how interference with EWS contributes to Ewing sarcoma formation. Here, we demonstrate that EWS/FLI1- and EWS-knockdown cells display a high incidence of defects in the midzone, a midline structure located between segregating chromatids during anaphase. Defects in the midzone can lead to the failure of cytokinesis and can result in the induction of aneuploidy. The similarity among the phenotypes of EWS/FLI1- and EWS siRNA-transfected HeLa cells points to the inhibition of EWS as the key mechanism for the induction of midzone defects. Supporting this observation, the ectopic expression of EWS rescues the high incidence of midzone defects observed in Ewing sarcoma A673 cells. We discovered that EWS interacts with Aurora B kinase, and that EWS is also required for recruiting Aurora B to the midzone. A domain analysis revealed that the R565 in the RGG3 domain of EWS is essential for both Aurora B interaction and the recruitment of Aurora B to the midzone. Here, we propose that the impairment of EWS-dependent midzone formation via the recruitment of Aurora B is a potential mechanism of Ewing sarcoma development.',\n","  'qas': [{'id': '552fac4fbc4f83e828000006_009',\n","    'is_impossible': False,\n","    'question': 'Which fusion protein is involved in the development of Ewing sarcoma?',\n","    'answers': [{'text': 'EWS/FLI1', 'answer_start': 287}]}]}]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":23}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# SimpleTransformer Model Training"],"metadata":{"id":"dkV5zDP1pW8c"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Install simpletransformers\n","!pip install simpletransformers"],"metadata":{"id":"Y7ZdhDWJKvq6"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["* Usage Steps\n","\n","\n","* * Initialize a QuestionAnsweringModel\n","* * Train the model with **train_model()**\n","* * Evaluate the model with **eval_model()**\n","* * Make predictions on (unlabelled) data with **predict()**\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"wFC1-1Papd-j"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import logging\n","from simpletransformers.question_answering import QuestionAnsweringModel, QuestionAnsweringArgs\n","\n","\n","logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n","transformers_logger = logging.getLogger(\"transformers\")\n","transformers_logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)"],"metadata":{"id":"NQFpdbMaKogO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1642449148020,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":13736,"user":{"displayName":"Abhisek Saha","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgsbRHkd4Ug7pkvp0UqxcssHlG-AkBHnKY1GNCo=s64","userId":"06504023352493631962"}}},"execution_count":24,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["To create a QuestionAnsweringModel, you must specify a model_type and a model_name.\n","\n","* **model_type** should be one of the model types from the supported models (e.g. bert, electra, xlnet)\n","\n","* **model_name** specifies the exact architecture and trained weights to use.

Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is characterized by early-onset carcinogenesis involving multiple tumor types and shows autosomal dominant inheritance. Approximately 70% of LFS cases are due to germline mutations in the TP53 gene on chromosome 17p13.1. Mutations have also been found in the CHEK2 gene on chromosome 22q11, and others have been mapped to chromosome 11q23. While characterizing an LFS family with a documented defect in TP53, we found one family member who developed bilateral breast cancer at age 37 yet was homozygous for wild-type TP53. Her mother also developed early-onset primary bilateral breast cancer, and a sister had unilateral breast cancer and a soft tissue sarcoma. Cytogenetic analysis using fluorescence in situ hybridization of a primary skin fibroblast cell line revealed that the patient had a novel balanced reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 11 and 15: t(11;15)(q23;q15). This translocation was not present in a primary skin fibroblast cell line from a brother with neuroblastoma, who was heterozygous for the TP53 mutation. There was no evidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in either the patient or her mother, although a nephew did develop leukemia and died in childhood. These data may implicate the region at breakpoint 11q23 and/or 15q15 as playing a significant role in predisposition to breast cancer development.',\n","  'qas': [{'id': '52bf208003868f1b06000019_002',\n","    'is_impossible': False,\n","    'question': 'What is the inheritance pattern of Li–Fraumeni syndrome?'\n","    }]\n","     }\n","]\n","\n","answers, probabilities = model.predict(to_predict)\n","\n","print(answers)\n","print(probabilities)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":156,"referenced_widgets":["9434b33e8af84918b379bb0934eab09f","e2bf57895e2a4782b38c1a26300a0f68","91adbb3abfaa4e18a099b458ef8d45b9","205824dff3ad45d7ac0b7e02009288ed","fb9c01fd6c404559851df7addf1d4daa","a9165ba1dcb144f88e6ac32e73f5e2ba","5ba1d37a082d4183a1958fe035d488c0","6663dbb24d2046d082b23509e1bac88b","6a3809690ffd43e6ae91916d467011d1","ce94b73c259245ce90a1d4332094bfa7","b6866c72359d4259a8f280c61f06b559"]},"id":"GP3zBe2SMQ5j","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1642449709796,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":425,"user":{"displayName":"Abhisek Saha","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgsbRHkd4Ug7pkvp0UqxcssHlG-AkBHnKY1GNCo=s64","userId":"06504023352493631962"}},"outputId":"4cfec202-eb9b-4ce4-829c-e96729997ec4"},"execution_count":30,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["INFO:simpletransformers.question_answering.question_answering_model: Converting to features started.\n","convert squad examples to features: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:00<00:00, 44.84it/s]\n","add example index and unique id: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:00<00:00, 4999.17it/s]\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"9434b33e8af84918b379bb0934eab09f","version_minor":0,"version_major":2},"text/plain":["Running Prediction:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[{'id': '52bf208003868f1b06000019_002', 'answer': ['autosomal dominant', 'autosomal dominant inheritance', 'autosomal']}]\n","[{'id': '52bf208003868f1b06000019_002', 'probability': [0.9246951034430451, 0.07158390908618548, 0.0037204293015799645]}]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"dtPwt2dkMwaa"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
